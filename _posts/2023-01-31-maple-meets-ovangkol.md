Dovetail time! YES! 

Dovetails are probably the most beautiful wood joints out there. With their unique style they are immediately recognizable. Fun fact: It is believed that dovetails were originally not invented for decorative purposes. Rather, they were used for drawers and at situations where high tensile strength is needed. Thats another cool thing about dovetails: they are super strong. A tight dovetail joint will hold together for centuries ... probably even without glue. However, nowadays you find dovetails as a decorative element for boxes, drawers, cabinets, etc.

Attempting dovetails by hand is a bit intimidating at first, but once you are start sawing and chiseling it is endless fun :D 

OK, enough about dovetails. Let's talk about this project.

I basically planned on building a box for my mother because she likes boxes as storage for pens and other office stuff. Since I always want to extend my skills I decided to make dovetail joinery, some nice inlay work and a base inserted via grooves. 


The wood of choice for this box is curly maple for fronts and sides as well as ovangkol for inlay works and the base as well as the cover. Since the piece of maple was around 45 mm thick, the first step to obtain the boards was to split the wood by using my Ryoba japanese saw (the attentive reader might see that the piece of maple was initially planned for a guitar headstock). Splitting wood is absolutely possible with handsaws but takes some patience until you end up with two pieces.

After the wood was split, the next step was to plane the boards to size which revealed a wonderful shiny curly maple texture. How nice is that :)

Once all boards were planed to size, the next step was to do the inlay work. Unfortunately, I did not document this step while building, so I dont have pictures here to show. I kept the inlay work quite simple with straightforward shapes since my ability to do fancy inlays is still quite limited. To get a nice contrast, I used some leftover of ovangkol wood and chiseled out the areas in order to fit the inlays. The inlays were glued and pressed into the cavity and planed flush to the surface.

So far so good. The "easy" stuff is done. Now comes the tough part. Dovetailing. 

I was so focused during dovetailing that I only took one picture of the build. I did not plan a lot on how to layout the dovetails (I have the feeling that some people are almost studying this). It was more a gut feeling on what looked best to me, so thats why I ended up with 4 tails and 5 pins. I had some troubles with my dovetails because they were so tight that it was impossible to join them together. After a lot of correction work with the chisel I finally ended up with (still very tight) joints. Looking at the joinery, I definitely need to improve my sawing skills as there are many visible gaps (see picture).

Fortunately, all gaps can be fixed somehow. Smaller gaps have been fixed by using glue and sawdust whereas bigger gaps were fixed using small chips of wood and glueing them into the gap. After "gap fixing" and planing flush the joint came out pretty amazing

Next up is the cover (or lid) of the box. I decided to take the easy way, a cover which can be put on top of the box without handles. One thing to notice is that in order to avoid slipping, it is helpful to add rabbets on each side which hold the cover in place. For the rabbets, the router plane is your best friend. However, I faced problems with tearout (look closer), but since this is on the bottom side of the cover (which no one will see anyways) I didn't take it that serious ;)

Finally, I applied two layers of oil finish to the box, polished everything with a 1500 grid micro mesh and was rewarded with a really nice result. Some eyecatcher pictures shown below ;)
