Dovetail time! YES! 

Dovetails are probably the most beautiful wood joints out there. With their unique style they are immediately recognizable. Fun fact: It is believed that dovetails were originally not invented for decorative purposes. Rather, they were used for drawers and at situations where high tensile strength is needed. Thats another cool thing about dovetails: they are super strong. A tight dovetail joint will hold together for centuries ... probably even without glue. However, nowadays you find dovetails as a decorative element for boxes, drawers, cabinets, etc.

Attempting dovetails by hand is a bit intimidating at first, but once you are start sawing and chiseling it is endless fun :D 

OK, enough about dovetails. Let's talk about this project.

I basically planned on building a box for my mother because she likes boxes as storage for pens and other office stuff. Since I always want to extend my skills I decided to make dovetail joinery, some nice inlay work and a base inserted via grooves. 

The wood of choice for this box is curly maple for fronts and sides as well as ovangkol for inlay works and the base as well as the cover. Since the piece of maple was around 45 mm thick, the first step to obtain the boards was to split the wood by using my Ryoba japanese saw (the attentive reader might see that the piece of maple was initially planned for a guitar headstock). Splitting wood is absolutely possible with handsaws but takes some patience until you end up with two pieces.
